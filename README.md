## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During the development of this project, I learned a lot about flexbox and how it can be used to create layouts. I faced some challenges with getting the sizes and proportions of elements to appear as I wanted, especially in a responsive setting. I also learned about the `flex` shorthand property and how it can cause unintended side-effects in certain situations.

Here's some CSS code I wrote for the project:

```css
.card-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  width: 44rem;
  height: 30rem;
  margin: 0 auto;
  margin-bottom: 4rem; /* for the attribution */
}

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue focusing on mastering flexbox and learning more about grid. I also want to dive deeper into responsive design, as it's an essential part of modern web development. I'm particularly interested in learning more about media queries and how to effectively use them to create responsive layouts.

#### In general

This is what was recommended for me when I asked ChatGPT the question.  I am amazed!

*JavaScript frameworks and libraries:* As you become more proficient in vanilla JavaScript, you might want to explore popular frameworks 
and libraries like React, Angular, or Vue.js. These tools can help you build more complex and feature-rich applications with better per
formance and maintainability.

*CSS preprocessors:* Learning CSS preprocessors like Sass or Less can help you write more organized and maintainable CSS code. These to
ols offer features like variables, mixins, and nesting that can make your stylesheets more modular and scalable.

*State management:* As your applications grow in complexity, managing application state becomes more challenging. Learning state manage
ment libraries like Redux or MobX for React applications, or Vuex for Vue.js applications, can help you manage state effectively and bu
ild more complex applications.

*Accessibility:* Understanding web accessibility best practices and techniques is essential to build inclusive web applications. Focus on learning how to make your applications accessible to a wider range of users, including those with disabilities.

*Performance optimization:* Learn about performance optimization techniques such as lazy-loading, code splitting, and caching to ensure that your applications load quickly and provide a smooth user experience.

*Testing:* Become familiar with testing tools and methodologies, like unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing. Learning testing frameworks like Jest, Mocha, or Cypress can help you create more robust and reliable applications.

*Web APIs:* Deepen your knowledge of various web APIs, such as the Fetch API, Web Storage API, and Geolocation API. This can help you create more feature-rich and interactive applications.

*Version control:* If you haven't already, learn how to use a version control system like Git to better manage your code, collaborate with others, and track changes in your projects.

*Build tools and bundlers:* Familiarize yourself with build tools like Webpack, Parcel, or Rollup.js to automate tasks, bundle your assets, and optimize your application for production.

*Backend development:* As you become more comfortable with frontend development, you may want to explore backend development with technologies like Node.js, Express, or Django. Learning about databases, RESTful APIs, and server-side rendering can help you become a full-stack developer.
